That’s worked well so far, but as your cloud native deployments grow and enhanced services are added, new solutions are needed. <br><br>First, there is <strong>currently no API to map Kubernetes services and policies to network configurations</strong> so it’s up to you or the network plugin implementers to figure this out. A standard suite of <strong>APIs based on open source code would solve that problem for you</strong>. <br><br>Second, the use of <strong>kube-proxy (with iptables) limits network performance, scale and feature update cycles.</strong> required to meet your service and policy demands. Moving all <strong>network functions (including data plane and control plane) to user space increases performance, scale, reliability and innovation velocity.</strong>"
