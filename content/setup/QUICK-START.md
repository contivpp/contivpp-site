## Get Started

You can get started with Contivpp.io using one of serveral methods:

* Use the [Contivpp.io Vagrant Installation](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/vagrant/README.md) instructions to start a
  simulated Kubernetes cluster with a couple of hosts running in VirtualBox
  VMs. This is the easiest way to bring up a cluster for exploring the
  capabilities and features of contivpp.io.

  __Note: The vagrant production solution (2 x worker nodes and without Steal-the-Nic) is used in the Demo section.__

* Use the [Contiv-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md) instructions to manually
  install Kubernetes with contivpp.io networking on one or more bare-metal

* Use the [Arm64-specific kubeadm install](https://github.com/contiv/vpp/blob/master/docs/arm64/MANUAL_INSTALL_ARM64.md) instructions to manually
  install Kubernetes with contivpp.io networking on one or more bare-metal
  of Arm64 platform.
