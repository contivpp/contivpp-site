This is the contivpp.io website. It was created using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Airspace Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/airspace-hugo/).

NOTE: The theme has been added as a git submodule, so to ensure this is checked out
when you clone this repository, run your clone as follows:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:contivpp/contivpp-site.git
```

To quickly install Hugo, follow [this link](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

To run the site after cloning (with fast rendering disabled), run the following:

```
hugo server --disableFastRender
```
